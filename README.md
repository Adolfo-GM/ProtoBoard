# ProtoBoard

The ProtoBoard is an open-source I/O control board designed for easy assembly from common household items. It features random signal generation (RAND), LED status indicator (led goes inside the board enclouser and can be attached with anything such as tape to the isnide, it connects directly to the power through a reistor), 2 input wires for power +/-. A RΩ pin that outputs (+) with resistance (any ressiotr you may aqurie) and V+ (simply provides + power) and a GND connection (-). The protoboard has a 4 row breadboard array of 4x5 (notw that this breadboard array isnt connected to anything, its meant to be used as a breadboard with jumper wires). x2 columns for +/- (internally copnnected to the power. ) Overall, the ProtoBoard is a mini control board with a breadboard for prototyping ith electronics. 

## Features
- **Random Signal Generation**: A RAND pin outputs a random on/off signal.
- **LED Status Indicator**: Onboard LED provides visual feedback for power status.
- **Compact Square Design**: Ideal for simple projects.

## Total Pins
The ProtoBoard includes a total of **42 pins**:
x1 **+ Battery Pin**: Connect the positive terminal of your power source.
x1 **- Battery Pin**: Connect the negative terminal of your power source.
x1 **RAND Pin**: Outputs a random on/off + signal generated by the randomness module.
x1 **Ground (GND) Pin**: Provides a ground connection.
x1 **Resistor Pin (RΩ)**: Outputs a lower voltage, ideal for components requiring reduced power.
x20 **Breadboard array (4x5)**: a mini on-board breadboard.
x1 **V+ Pin**: Outputs (+) direct power.
x8 **(+) colum**: A column of 8 pins that output + power.
x8 **(-) colum**: A column of 8 pins that output - power.

## Assembly
The ProtoBoard is designed to be easy to assemble using basic components:
1. **Prepare Components**: Gather basic parts such as wires, resistors, LEDs, a 3d printed (or handmade) enclosure, aluminum foi, etc.
2. **Assemble the Board**:
   - Connect the power input pins (**+ Battery** and **- Battery**) to your board.
   - Connect an LED directly to the power source for the status indicator, and tape it iside such tat its not visisble but the light is seen through the encloisure. 
   - Install the randomness module and connect on end to the **Randomness Pin** and the other to the (+) battery input, connect it throught the randomness mdoule.
   - Include a resistor inline with the **Resistor Pin** for voltage regulation.
   - Conect the rows and columns to themselfs for the breadboard array
   - pass power to the +/- columns acordingly from the power source.
3. **Test the Board**: Once assembled, test each pin to ensure proper functionality.

## Randomness Module Assembly Guide

The randomness module generates random on/off signals. Here's how to build it:

### Materials Needed
- Two short wires
- Soldering iron
- Electrical tape or heat shrink tubing
- Aluminum foil

### Steps
1. **Prepare the Wires**:
   - Cut and strip two short pieces of wire.

2. **Create the Randomness Mechanism**:
   - Crumple a small piece of aluminum foil into a loose ball.
   - Solder one wire to each side of the foil.

3. **Install in the Board**:
   - Place the foil inside the board where it can move slightly( the board has a small sqaure space where this can be attached lossely).
   - Connect one wire to the **+ Battery Pin** and the other to the **Randomness Pin** on the ProtoBoard.

4. **Test the Module**:
   - Power the board and observe random pulses at the **Randomness Pin** as the foil shifts due to small vibrations.

### How It Works
The foil moves with small vibrations, intermittently completing the circuit and generating random on/off signals for the **Randomness Pin**.
