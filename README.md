# ProtoBoard

The ProtoBoard is an open-source I/O control board designed for easy assembly from common household items. It features random signal generation (RAND), an LED status indicator (the LED resides inside the board enclosure and can be secured with tape. It connects directly to the power via a resistor), two input wires for power (+/-), and additional pins for versatile usage. These include an RΩ pin (outputs positive power with resistance, based on any resistor you have), a V+ pin (provides direct positive power), and a GND connection (-). The ProtoBoard also incorporates a 4x5 breadboard array for prototyping, allowing jumper wire connections without internal pre-wiring. 

## Features
- **Random Signal Generation**: A RAND pin outputs a random on/off signal.
- **LED Status Indicator**: Onboard LED provides visual feedback for power status.
- **Compact Square Design**: Ideal for simple and quick prototyping.

## Total Pins
The ProtoBoard includes a total of **42 pins**:
- **1 x + Battery Pin**: Connect the positive terminal of your power source.
- **1 x - Battery Pin**: Connect the negative terminal of your power source.
- **1 x RAND Pin**: Outputs a random on/off positive signal generated by the randomness module.
- **1 x Ground (GND) Pin**: Provides a ground connection.
- **1 x Resistor Pin (RΩ)**: Outputs a lower voltage via an inline resistor.
- **20 x Breadboard Array Pins (4x5)**: A mini onboard breadboard for prototyping.
- **1 x V+ Pin**: Outputs direct positive power.
- **8 x (+) Column Pins**: Outputs continuous positive power.
- **8 x (-) Column Pins**: Outputs continuous negative power.

## Assembly
The ProtoBoard is designed for straightforward assembly using basic components:

1. **Prepare Components**: Gather materials such as wires, resistors, LEDs, a 3D-printed or handmade enclosure, aluminum foil, etc.
2. **Assemble the Board**:
   - Connect the power input pins (**+ Battery** and **- Battery**) to the power source.
   - Secure the LED inside the enclosure so that its light is visible through the material. Connect it directly to the power source via a resistor.
   - Install the randomness module by connecting one end to the **Randomness Pin** and the other to the **+ Battery Pin**.
   - Attach a resistor inline with the **Resistor Pin** for voltage regulation.
   - Link the rows and columns of the breadboard array for jumper wire usage.
   - Connect power to the **+/- columns** appropriately from the power source.
3. **Test the Board**: Once assembled, verify each pin's functionality.

## Randomness Module Assembly Guide

The randomness module generates random on/off signals for the RAND pin. 

### Materials Needed
- Two short wires
- Soldering iron
- Electrical tape or heat shrink tubing
- Aluminum foil

### Steps
1. **Prepare the Wires**:
   - Cut and strip two short pieces of wire.

2. **Create the Randomness Mechanism**:
   - Crumple a small piece of aluminum foil into a loose ball.
   - Solder one wire to each side of the foil.

3. **Install in the Board**:
   - Place the foil inside the designated square compartment on the board where it can move slightly.
   - Connect one wire to the **+ Battery Pin** and the other to the **Randomness Pin**.

4. **Test the Module**:
   - Power the board and observe random pulses at the **Randomness Pin** as the foil shifts due to small vibrations.

### How It Works
The foil moves with small vibrations, intermittently completing the circuit and generating random on/off signals for the **Randomness Pin**.
